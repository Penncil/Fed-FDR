To run the simulation study:

1. Execute the following R scripts:
   - simulation_n500p500.R
   - simulation_n500p1000.R
   - simulation_n1000p500.R
   - simulation_scalebility.R

2. Save the resulting simulation outputs as .rds files in the "simulation_result" folder.

3. To generate the simulation plots, navigate to the "results" folder and run:
   - Figure1.R
   - Figure2.R
   - Figure3.R
