## Simulation Code

###  Implementation of simulation under different settings:

#### Folder name: 
- simulation_result

#### R scripts to implementaion:
 - simulation_n500p500.R
 - simulation_n500p1000.R
 - simulation_n1000p500.R
 - simulation_scalebility.R

#### Instruction for replication of simulation studies:
1. Download the R scripts from our repo
2. Use R or RStudio to run the R scripts
3. Results will be automatcially saved as .rds files
4. To generate the simulation results figures as in the manuscript, please download and run the following corresponding R scripts:
   
   4.1. Figure1.R
   
   4.2. Figure2.R
   
   4.3.Figure3.R
